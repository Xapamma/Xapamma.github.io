    "text": "Projects\n\nAutomated Personal Finance Dashboard (In Progress): Developing a web-based financial dashboard that automatically pulls and cleans bank data to deliver clear, real-time insights into spending, cash flow, and financial trends. Designed to support better financial understanding and communication through intuitive, data-driven visuals. Built with a focus on scalable automation, user clarity, and responsible data handling using Python, SQL, and modern dashboard frameworks.\nConsumer Price Index (CPI) Food Cost Analysis: Analyzed 10 years of U.S. CPI data to explore food price trends, seasonality, and inflation relative to the recommended 2% annual benchmark.\n\nData & Methods: Merged monthly CPI data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics with annual food-category CPI data from the USDA. Cleaned, reshaped, and analyzed data using R (tidyverse), calculating month-over-month and year-over-year percent changes.\n\nKey Findings: Food prices tend to be higher earlier in the year, suggesting mild seasonal patterns. Inflation remained near 2% pre-2020, spiked above 6% post-2020, and has since stabilized closer to 3%. Among food categories, eggs showed the greatest volatility, while most categories peaked around 2022 and later declined.\n\nVisualization & Tools: Created exploratory and explanatory visualizations with ggplot2, including seasonal trend plots and food-group comparisons. Used AI selectively for debugging, table styling, and visualization refinement while maintaining full analytical control.\n\nPopcorn Popping Time Experiment: Investigated how oil type (olive, vegetable, coconut) and kernel timing (cold start vs. preheated) affect total popping time. Using a fully randomized 2x3 factorial design with 5 replications per treatment, we measured popping efficiency in seconds.\n\nKey Findings: Preheating the oil significantly increased popping time, while oil type and the interaction between oil type and kernel timing were not significant.\n\nApproach: ANOVA and residual diagnostics were used to validate assumptions, ensuring results were statistically sound.\n\nImpact: Demonstrates practical applications in kitchen efficiency and provides experience in designing, randomizing, and analyzing factorial experiments."
