## Background

My name is **Savanna Kerby**, and I am a senior studying **Applied Statistics** at **Brigham Young University**. Originally from South Jordan, UT, I have a passion for using technical skills to solve business problems and automate workflows. My interest in data science comes from a desire to transform complex data into actionable growth strategies for entrepreneurs and organizations.  

I am actively building skills in **Python, R, SQL, Applied AI/ML, Excel, and Tableau**, and I aim to use these tools to support small businesses, international organizations, and humanitarian projects. My career goals include starting a **business intelligence consulting firm**, improving refugee support systems through technology, and helping international businesses optimize operations through data analysis.

For my portfolio, I have completed or am working on projects such as:  
- **Popcorn ANOVA Analysis** — an experimental design project  
- **CPI Data Visualization Report** — analyzing consumer price index trends  
- **Personal Finance Dashboard** — a custom software solution for automated financial tracking  
- …and many more to come!
