## Projects

- **Automated Personal Finance Dashboard (In Progress):** Developing a web-based financial dashboard that automatically pulls and cleans bank data to deliver clear, real-time insights into spending, cash flow, and financial trends. Designed to support better financial understanding and communication through intuitive, data-driven visuals. Built with a focus on scalable automation, user clarity, and responsible data handling using Python, SQL, and modern dashboard frameworks. 
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI) Food Cost Analysis:** Analyzed 10 years of U.S. CPI data to explore food price trends, seasonality, and inflation relative to the recommended 2% annual benchmark.  
  - **Data & Methods:** Merged monthly CPI data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics with annual food-category CPI data from the USDA. Cleaned, reshaped, and analyzed data using R (tidyverse), calculating month-over-month and year-over-year percent changes.  
  - **Key Findings:** Food prices tend to be higher earlier in the year, suggesting mild seasonal patterns. Inflation remained near 2% pre-2020, spiked above 6% post-2020, and has since stabilized closer to 3%. Among food categories, eggs showed the greatest volatility, while most categories peaked around 2022 and later declined.  
  - **Visualization & Tools:** Created exploratory and explanatory visualizations with ggplot2, including seasonal trend plots and food-group comparisons. Used AI selectively for debugging, table styling, and visualization refinement while maintaining full analytical control.

- **Popcorn Popping Time Experiment:** Investigated how oil type (olive, vegetable, coconut) and kernel timing (cold start vs. preheated) affect total popping time. Using a fully randomized 2x3 factorial design with 5 replications per treatment, we measured popping efficiency in seconds.  
  - **Key Findings:** Preheating the oil significantly increased popping time, while oil type and the interaction between oil type and kernel timing were not significant.  
  - **Approach:** ANOVA and residual diagnostics were used to validate assumptions, ensuring results were statistically sound.  
  - **Impact:** Demonstrates practical applications in kitchen efficiency and provides experience in designing, randomizing, and analyzing factorial experiments.
